# Mark Lannen MART 441
## HW-1 Readme
### Process

I actually built the site twice because I had not spent enough time planning the layout and wound up with messy code that suffered from 'code bloat.' Once I reorganized, things went better. 

I was pleased that I managed a hero image with paralax scrolling and my css buttons looked how I wanted them to, along with their hover states. However, I did have quite a few issues that I was never able to resolve. When I took the MART 341 class, the instructor was AWOL and/or unresponsive for long periods of the course, and doing this assignment has exposed the many gaps in my css knowlede that I will need to fill in as quickly as possible. In particular, I did not do very well with element positioning and media queries, which I will discuss below.  

## Successes

As mentioned, I was pleased that I got the hero image to work and the paralax scrolling looks good. I think I also did a decent job of wrapping header elements in containers that I could then set background colors for. 

I also was able to get google fonts and hover states on the buttons to work which was satisfying. 

## Difficulties

Sadly, there were quite a few. 

1. Postioning. As I mentioned, I really need to fill in the gaps in my knowledge on how to get elements to position the way I want them to. I did have my buttons centered and stacked on top of each other in smaller screen sizes. But at some point they moved left and I could not figure out how to re-center them!  Also, most of my elements were inset from the edge of the screen, so they looked ragged. I spent quite a bit of time trying to fix this issue, to no avail. I would like to figure out what is going on so that I avoid this mistake in the future.

2. Media queries. Some of my media queries worked, but many others did not. What I wanted to do was have the buttons go from display: block to display: inline at a certain width and then span the screen as the size increased. But I could not get this behavior to work in spite of hours spent experimenting. The same was true for doing something as simple as changing the font size of text. The media queries worked when I targed the text in the header, but not at all when I targeted h1 and h2 elements further down the page. I spent a large amount of time experimenting and trying to fix this, but because of time I eventually had to give up. 

So, my biggest takeaway from this homework is that I have many gaps in my css knowledge, particularly in the areas of positioning and media queries.
