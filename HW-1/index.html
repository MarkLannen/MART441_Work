                <h2>Information about me</h2>
                <p>
                    I graduated from the University of Montana with a Liberal Studies degree,
                    after which I moved to England where I lived and worked for about 10 years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After returning to the States my wife and I moved to Missoula almost four years
                    ago. She is a shiatsu practitioner and has a growing practise in Missoula. I work 
                    at the University and am enrolled in Media Arts and Computer Science classes in order to retrain
                    as a web developer/programmer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not hunched over my computer either working or studying, we spend as much time as possible
                    in Montana wilderness areas hiking, backpacking, cross country skiing and taking photographs. 
                    The past couple of summers we have backpacked through different areas of the Bob Marshall wilderness complex and 
                    are now thoroughly hooked!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used to have a hobby of reading books about history, but ever since I've gone back to school
                    I only seem to have enough time for technical manuals and video tutorials...
