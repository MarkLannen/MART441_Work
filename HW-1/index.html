                I graduated from the University of Montana with a Liberal Studies degree,
                after which I moved to England where I lived and worked for about 10 years.

                After returning to the States my wife and I moved to Missoula almost four years
                ago. She is a shiatsu practitioner and has a growing practise in Missoula. I work 
                at the University and am enrolled in Media Arts and Computer Science classes in order to retrain
                as a web developer/programmer.

                When I'm not either hunched over my computer working or studying, we spend as much time as possible
                in Montana wilderness areas hiking, backpacking, cross country skiing and taking photographs. 
                The past 3 summers we have backpacked through different areas of the Bob Marshall wilderness complex and 
                are now thoroughly hooked!
