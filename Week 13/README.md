### Process
I really enjoyed this project. I spent the bulk of my time picking apart your example
and going through all the logic step by step and I feel like for the first time that
I 'got' the bigger picture and how it is all connected.

## Successes
My biggest success was just getting everything to work and adding a few things like
messages that appeared when the game was complete or the player lost.

## Difficulties

The biggest difficulty, and one that I never managed to fix, is that there is some
errror in the collision for the red (collectible) squares. For whatever reason when I
hit one, sometimes several disappear. I tried console logging the length of the array
after each .pop, but I just could not work out why this was happening. I think I'll
need to understand better how collisions work and maybe fix something like this
the next time it happens.
