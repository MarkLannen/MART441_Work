## HW-8 Readme
### Process
Not going to lie - I didn't do very well on this homework.  :)
I spent quite a bit of time on Saturday trying to fix something that was
not actually broken. By the time I realized that their was no problem with my code,
but that vs live server was not working on Chrome, I had basically run out of time to
finish.

## Successes
The only real success was setting up the image class and getting the images
into an array and then the click event to work with jQuery.

## Difficulties
It's pretty obvious that I did not finish the homework, which was frustrating, but
at least now I know that live server was an issue, and has been all semester.
From now on I won't have to spend so much time being frustrated by it!
I didn't really take in everything on jQuery so I'll have to go back and re-read
week 8 before moving on to next week.
