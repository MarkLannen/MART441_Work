### Process
I started very simply and slowly built everything up. I tried not to move on until
the current thing was working

### Success
My biggest success was declaring the class and then instantiating it properly. I was
also very pleased that I eventually got the background color to change. Not entirely sure
why I had to use 'background' in the .js file when it was 'background-color' in the css.
Will have to look that one up.  :)

### Difficulties
As usual, my biggest challenge was seeing the bigger picture and understanding the
control flow and how all the individual elements worked together. This is
becoming clearer to me as the weeks go by, but I still need quite a bit
practise before it becomes more intuitive.
