## HW-9 Readme

### Process
Apologies that this is late! I read and re-read the material and by the time I really
started on the homework I ran in to some roadblocks and couldn't really get them
sorted out until today.

Anyway, I was pleased that I eventually got everything to work and have at least a
basic grasp on jquery, AJAX etc.

Once I understood the syntax for getting the JSON file info and parsing, the biggest
challenge was to get it to display properly in a table. The display is not all that interesting,
but I was mostly focused on getting everything to work. I was particularly pleased
that I managed to loop through the JSON file and extract the bits that I wanted and display
them in a somewhat reasonable way.

I know what I have done here is pretty basic, but I think I have understood how it
all works together and hopefully I can incrementally add complexity and still get
the functionality I want.
