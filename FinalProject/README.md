## Final Project Readme

### Process
I spent several weeks on this game, and the scope changed a bit as I realized I had bitten off a little more than I could chew.
I started with creating the array and populating it with the country images. Then I worked on creating the classes, and 
changing the code structure so that it was more object-oriented. I then spent quite a bit of time just trying to get
the basic game to work. When I finally got to that point, I then did my best to style the game so that it looks a little
more appealing.

### Success
My biggest success was eventually getting the basic game to work. I was particularly pleased with myself when I got every 
edge of each country to bounce evenly off of the canvas edge. 

### Difficulties
As usual, my biggest challenge was seeing the bigger picture and understanding the
control flow and how all the individual elements worked together. This is
becoming clearer to me as the weeks go by, but I still need quite a bit
practise before it becomes more intuitive.
