## HW-5 Readme

### Process
This was an interesting challenge. My plan had been to use your example code as a starting point and 
then try to come up with a different way of achieving the same result. So I spent the first few days picking apart all the logic and making sure I clearly understood what all the parts were doing. 

After that I did add a few more photos and did a layout that I was happy with. I had originally put everything in <tr> and <td> tags, etc..., but I'm not a big fan of using tables for layout so with your help I did a flexbox version that I think is much better. 

## Successes
I went through the code line by line and really made sure I understood what was happening. It was actually a great learning exercise and I'm starting to feel more comfortable with manipulating DOM elements using JavaScript. It's not intuitive yet, as I will probably need to do quite a bit more of it for that to happen, but it's not completely new to me anymore - very rewarding!

Another success was just adding extra pictures and being able to adjust the code so that all the elements on my page loaded and displayed properly.

I'm also pleased to be getting a bit more comfortable with flexbos - so much easier to use than floats! Next week I think I'll try to add a menu bar that does 'something' just to get a bit of practise using flexbox for that. 

## Difficulties
I was generally disappointed that I wasn't able to come up with a different way of achieving the same results. I did 'break' several parts of the code and tried using different logic, but I never managed to get the page working properly that way. The main thing I tried to do was to come up with different methods for populating the arrays, adding ID's to the html elements, or even loading the parameters in to the flipImage function in a more automated way. I think I did get close once or twice, but was never able to debug to the point where everything worked again. Then I ran out of time and needed to hand it in as/is. So, even though that was a disappointment, I do feel that I have a decent grasp on the logic of your code and hopefully next week I'll be able to do something a bit more original and creative.  :)
