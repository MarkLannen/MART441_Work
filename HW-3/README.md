### Process

In terms of process there wasn't a lot for the homework this week as the project itself was relatively simple. As such I spent the vast majority of my time this week going through Modules 9,10 and 11 from the 341 site to review all of those critical aspects of web development.  

I built a simple page with just a header that included an image and text. For practise I floated the image and set 2 breakpoints with media queires which resized the header text as the viewport expanded. I had difficulty with both of these processes last week so I'm pleased I was able to get them to work.

## Successes

Getting an element to float correctly and 2 media queries to work. 

## Difficulties

I'm still getting a margin around an element that I've set to 100% width. I don't know what is causing it, but have emailed professor Cassens a question about it.
