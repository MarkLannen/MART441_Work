# Mark Lannen MART 441
## HW-3 Readme
### Process

I spent most of my MART 441 refreshing my knowledge of JavaScript. I went through the codecademy exercises and studied the chapters from Eloquent JS as well as the first few sections of 'You Don't Know JavaScript' up and going.

I then built on the project from last week and focussed on adding a nav bar and the different sections. 

## Successes

I could remember most of the JavaScript we were responsible for learning, and what I didn't remember I was able to get back up to speed on. I also did a bit of extra practise writing a few simple loops and functions. 

## Difficulties

I'm still in need of much more practise with css. I ran out of time before I was able to style my page the way I wanted it, so I will spend as much time as I need to next week understanding how to get everything to look the way I want it to.

Also, I am in a class that uses Python, and I can occasionally get the syntax of the two confused! I imagine that will be something I have to deal with regularly this semester.  :)
