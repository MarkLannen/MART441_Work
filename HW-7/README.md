### Process 
The process was pretty straightforward on this one. I set up the project and then just systematically worked through all the steps. I'm getting better at doing just on thing at a time, debugging it if necessary, before moving on to the next step. After I got the viewfinder to work I then spent some time styling the presentation. All in all I was pretty satisfied with how it looks.

## Successes
My biggest success was getting the viewfinder to work by only having to reach out to Professor Cassens one time. It took me a little while to think through adding the elements to the array, and how to pass all the parameters of each instance. But it wasn't as difficult a process as the last two projects. Either this one was a bit easier, or I'm getting more comfortable with this.  :)

## Difficulties
The only real difficulty turned out to be a syntax issue that Prof Cassens sorted out. Other than that I managed my own debugging, which was great.
