## HW-6 Readme

### Process 
I was on a steep learning curve this week and spent the majority of my time watching and rewatching the instructional videos and deconstructing the code line by line. And while I was putting everything together I had quite a bit of debugging to do. I am getting better at reading the errors in the console and tracing back the problem. So even though it is often frustrating I'm sure the practise will serve me well in the future.

## Successes
My biggest success was getting the JSON to work. Several times I had started to post an issue to github asking for help, but then decided to go back and deconstruct the functionality line by line. I was actually very pleasantly surprised when the results printed out on the last page, as I thought I would have much more debugging to do. So, I think I have a good grasp of the general concept and functionality and was very pleased to get everything working.  

## Difficulties

As I mentioned I was on a steep learning curve for this project. In general I had to do a lot of debugging along with a lot of hard work trying to understand the logic of the program.
