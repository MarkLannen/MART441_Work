### Process

This was a very involved proces as all of the DOM manipulation is pretty new to me. Thank you 
for creating the instructional video! I would have really struggled to get going if I had not
had that as a reference.

At first I thought we were meant to make 2 subsequent choices for every choice, which would have meant I think 32 functions! I started down that path but the code got very complicated very quickly and I'm glad I realized that was not what you were after.

## Successes

I got everything to work the way I wanted to and managed to change pictures, colors and body copy. 

## Difficulties

The only difficulty that I wasn't able to eventually solve was that my text box and submit button are still displaying on the last step where there ar no choices. As far as I can tell they should be hidden. Will have to look at that and maybe see what is going wrong tomorrow.
