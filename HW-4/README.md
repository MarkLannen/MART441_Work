### Process

This was a very involved proces as all of the DOM manipulation is pretty new to me. Thank you 
for creating the instructional video! I would have really struggled to get going if I had not
had that as a reference.

At first I thought we were meant to make 2 subsequent choices for every choice, which would have meant I think 32 functions! I started down that path but the code got very complicated very quickly and I'm glad I realized that was not what you were after.

## Successes

I got most everything to work the way I wanted to and managed to change pictures, colors and body copy. 

## Difficulties

One difficulty was that my text box and submit button are still displaying on the last step where there are no choices. As far as I can tell they should be hidden. Will have to look at that and maybe see what is going wrong tomorrow.

Also, my else statements past the first choice are not working. If I type gibberish in to the text box I don't get the message that I should.
